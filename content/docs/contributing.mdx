## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Follow the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started)
4. Create a new branch for your changes

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-feature`
- `fix/bug-description`
- `docs/update-documentation`

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes
2. Test thoroughly
3. Ensure TypeScript compiles: `npm run build`
4. Check for linting errors: `npm run lint`

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: Add user profile editing
fix: Resolve status update race condition
docs: Update API documentation
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types
- Use proper interfaces/types
- Follow existing patterns

### React

- Use functional components
- Prefer Server Components when possible
- Use `"use client"` only when needed
- Follow React best practices

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing component patterns
- Maintain responsive design
- Support dark mode

## Component Guidelines

### Creating New Components

1. Place in appropriate directory:
   - Feature components: `components/`
   - UI components: `components/ui/`
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for props
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include loading states
5. Make accessible

### Component Structure

```tsx
"use client"; // Only if needed

import { ... } from "...";

interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

export function Component({ prop }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:
- Test on desktop browsers
- Test on mobile devices
- Test authentication flow
- Test all user interactions
- Verify error handling

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run build
```

This will catch TypeScript errors.
